<p>Source Control (also known as Version Control Software or VCS) is a tool which guarantees the safety of your code. A repository is a special folder which holds everything important. You can view or revert to any version 
of anything ever checked in to a repository, and view change logs and differences (diffs) of each set of changes. In addition, repositories can be quickly and easily moved on and off site. All professional programmers use 
source control to store their code. Losing code is a fairly critical catastrophe. Much of the code you'll write in a new language won't be worth keeping; but when it is, you're going to be very unhappy if you lose it, and 
being able to view old versions is a critical advantage when you accidentally introduce a new bug into your code. Each set of changes is called a "revision" and the act of setting all your current changes into one revision 
is called "committing".</p>

<p>The most common are Subversion, Mercurial, and Git. They are all free for all platforms. You can also get free online repository hosting from sites like github and bitbucket which will host your code for you, in case of 
loss or to share with other users. You can also get TortoiseHg, TortoiseSVN, and TortoiseGit for Windows which provide a much more user-friendly interface.</p>

<p>Mercurial and Git are what is known as DVCS, or Distributed VCS. This means that each person has their own full copy of the repository. Subversion is centralized- you host the repository on one server and everybody else
deals with that. DVCS are generally agreed to be much simpler to use. When hosting your repository on GitHub/BitBucket, they maintain a complete copy of the repository, and you can update their hosted copy to take into
account changes you added- but they can also add changes written by other people and merge the two together to produce one codebase. This makes them invaluable not only for backing up, but also collaboration.</p>
