<p>C++ is an old language that's been through many phases. You can find code written in C++ that's from all stages of it's lifetime and mirroring those best practices. What's more unfortunate is the teaching 
    material, and teachers, left from each of these periods who still teach them. These people not only teach bad code, but those who can see it generate an unnecessarily negative opinion of the language when they 
    accurately point out it's flaws. In addition, it's all too obvious that some, or many, language and library features simply no longer fit in C++.</p>

<p>C with Classes<br/>
The C with Classes dialect was the first. This is based on the original C++ compiler, CFront. At that time, the language was called C with Classes, and was effectively nothing more than C that happened to have a "class" 
keyword. More than that, this dialect is similar to C as it was in the mid 80's, so there are lots of period habits which modern C doesn't have. Covering C with Classes will also provide a solid beginning towards a study of 
C. However, contrary to popular belief, there is no need whatsoever to study C before C++.
</p>

<p>Objects<br/>
In about 1990 it became apparent that objects were quite a bit better than what came before, and they became effectively a new religion. If you had a problem, you wrote a class to solve it. Unfortunately, programmers at the 
time had little idea of how to actually use this great new feature, nor how it could interact with the other features of C++. Code written in this dialect tends to feature many, many, many classes, with little purpose. Also 
a good preparation for learning especially Java, and C#.
</p>

<p>Generic<br/>
In about 1993, it was discovered that a compiler feature called a "template" was basically the best thing since sliced bread. Templates solved many problems in the language in a clean, safe, and fast way. It also gave rise 
to TMP, or template meta-programming. Unfortunately, programming with them was hard, and people wrote some true abominations using templates when something simpler would have been preferable. 
</p>

<p>Modern<br/>
Begun in about 1995, Modern C++ combines the best aspects of all of the others. But it was necessary to wait some time for the right compilers to be built, and the language had to introduce a new version of the language to 
make coding Modern C++ easier. However, that version was finished as of 2011 (hence C++11), and compiler support is rapidly maturing.
</p>

<p>What's important to take away is that you need to be very cautious about what sources of C++ you learn from- especially on the Internet. If you're not careful, you'll end up writing some nasty, nasty stuff. You can find 
people who copy and paste C, or even Java, solutions to C++ problems. I reccomend, and frequent, Stack Overflow. They take OpenID, you can ask questions and get fast, accurate answers, and chat in the Lounge.</p>
