<p>The first thing any new user will require in order to gain knowledge of C++ is a compiler. A compiler is a tool that converts from C++ source code into an executable program. There are many compilers depending on your 
platform and needs. Some of the major compilers are given below:</p>

<p>GCC<br/>
Operates on all three platforms. The native GCC works for Unix, but can be compiled for Mac. MinGW ports this compiler to Windows. G++ has excellent C++11 support, but Unix tools are non-trivial to configure and set up, and 
even when they do work, they aren't as usable as many equivalents. Plus, it cannot cross compile to other desktop platforms. Contains many extensions which are not portable. G++ is free and open source under the GPL. </p>

<p>Clang<br/>
Based on LLVM, Clang is fast and with very good C++11 support. Whilst theoretically completely platform-independent, the reality is that Windows support is lacking, and the supporting tooling isn't the greatest. Clang is free
 and open source under the BSD and MIT licences.</p>

<p>Visual C++<br/>
Created by Microsoft, and both runs on and compiles for Windows only. C++11 is usable, if not good. However, VS is an integrated package, containing IDE, compiler, debugger, profiler, supporting libraries like PPL and AMP, 
and can have many helpful external packages like Tortoise integrated. VS possesses the most usable toolset by far, especially debugger. VS Express is free for all, Professional is free for anyone with an academic e-mail 
address, and Ultimate is free for anyone in a university participating in the MSDNAA program. </p>

<p>Online<br/>
There are a couple of online compilers. These take source code in an input form, compile it, and then execute it, showing the output. The most common two are liveworkspace.org and ideone.com. Both are based on G++, 
liveworkspace.org is much more up to date than ideone.com, but doesn't appear to allow adding input to the program. Good place to start for simple programs, can be accessed from anywhere, and don't require tool installation, 
but they don't feature anything except the most basic functionality. However, ultimately, these tutorials do not cover the intricacies of using each compiler. Most of them have simple tutorials as to how to use them.</p>
