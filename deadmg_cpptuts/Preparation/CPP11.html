<p>C++ is defined by an International Standards Committee. This Committee is Working Group 21 (WG21). After C++ became popular, it was submitted to ISO for Standardization, which was C++98. There was an update in 2003, and
now another in 2011, known as C++11. Directly, the document which defines the C++ language is known as the Standard, and the people who make this document are the Committee.</p>

<p>C++11 introduced many essential features which make writing modern C++ vastly easier than before. All the major compilers feature usable C++11 support- even the notoriously non-conformant Visual Studio. But this does mean 
that you will need to use the most recent version of whatever compiler you choose.</p>
