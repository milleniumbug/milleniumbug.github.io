<p>Object orientation is a rather difficult thing. It is the art of splitting up your code into a number of submodules which minimize their interactions with each other. As with ownership, module interaction should be 
a DAG, but you might get away with some small circular module interactions. The most fundamental unit is the class, but OO is kinda like a fractal- each level is OO in it's own right, from major subsystems like "Render" 
and "UI" to small classes like "Texture" and "Button". It's easy to get OO wrong, and we can see plenty of examples from all around.</p>
