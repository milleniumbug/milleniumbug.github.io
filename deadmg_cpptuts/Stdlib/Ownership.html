<h1>Ownership</h1>
<p>The ownership model in C++ models how the program deals with resources- usually memory, but can be arbitrary. The simplest example is <code>std::vector</code>. When you add an item, then you cannot delete that item- 
    you can only ask the vector to delete it. The vector <i>owns</i> that item. It has the right to destroy it when it wants to. When the vector is destroyed, the item is destroyed. All Standard containers own their 
    contents. For function-local objects, they are owned by their scope- when they go out of scope, they are destroyed, and you cannot prematurely destruct them (well, you can, but doing that would be very, very silly). 
    It is the compiler's job to destroy local objects.
</p>
<p>This ownership principle is recursive- if we have <code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>, then the outer vector owns the inner vector- which owns the int objects within it. When the outer vector is 
    destroyed, it'll take all the inner vectors with it- which will take all the int objects with them. An object of a class owns all it's member variables. All objects in C++ should have one, and exactly one, owner. In 
    addition, that owner should never be, directly or indirectly, itself. If an object owns itself, then it will never be destroyed, as that would only occur- when it is destroyed. This means that ownership should be 
    acyclic.
</p>
<p>While this is mighty convenient, things can get a little more problematic when considering owning objects that don't neatly fit into one of the containers we've previously looked at- they are all multiple-object 
    value systems. Now we will look at the converse- single object, pointer systems. These are known as "Smart pointers". In this case, the pointer owns the pointed-to object in some fashion. When the pointer is destroyed, 
    it will take action to destroy the pointee.
</p>
<p>To kick it off, the non-owning pointer- <code>T*</code>- also known as a raw pointer or, rarely, naked pointer or dumb pointer. This allows us to point to an object owned by someone else. References are often used 
    for the same purpose in function bodies, parameters, and return types, although member references are exceedingly annoying and should usually be avoided.
