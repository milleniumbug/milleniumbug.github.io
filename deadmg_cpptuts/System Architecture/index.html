<p>The underlying CPU and operating system that you are running on will heavily influence the code that you write. Understanding them and their mechanisms will yield much more efficient code. Memory and other 
    architecture-based optimizations are the most significant, after algorithmic optimizations, and can even trump them for small data sizes.
</p>
<p>I have far from listed every niggle of hardware or operating systems that exists, or even that I know of. The main thing to understand here is that while C++ offers a very simple view, the underlying mechanisms are 
    very complex and should not be assumed to be equally simple, especially where performance is involved.
