<h1>The C++ Memory Model</h1>
<p>The C++ memory model defines what happens in the presence of concurrency. This model is known as SC-DRF, or Sequentially Consistent Data-Race Free. This is the same model as is used by C and Java, and languages in 
    general are converging on this model. We have already covered the DRF part. Now it's time to investigate what SC, or Sequentially Consistent, means.
