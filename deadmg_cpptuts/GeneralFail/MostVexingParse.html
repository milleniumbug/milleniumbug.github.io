<p>The Most Vexing Parse, or MVP, is another grammatical ambiguity in C++. Consider the following function:</p>
<div class="well"><code>
int main() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x();<br />
}
</code></div>
<p>You might reasonably conclude that <code>x</code> is a default-constructed <code>int</code>. Sorry, but no. It's actually a <i>function declaration</i>, which you may or may not have met already. Essentially, there 
is no real reason to do this, but strictly it's legal, and ambiguous, so the C++ Standard kindly defines that it should always be resolved to the one that nobody sane ever does, instead of the one that people do all 
the time. This isn't so bad, since you could just omit the parenthesis, but it gets worse when using temporaries, because you could have a <i>function declaration</i> which takes another function type as an argument.</p>
<div class="well"><code>
int main() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x(int());<br />
}</code></div>
<p><code>int</code> initialized from rvalue <code>int</code>, or function named <code>x</code> returning int and taking another function which takes nothing and returns <code>int</code>? Owch. To resolve this the way 
that you want, add additional parenthesis around the intended argument.</p>
<div class="well"><code>
int main() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x((int()));<br />
}</code></div>
<p>Now it's definitely an <code>int</code> initialized from a temporary <code>int</code>. MVP isn't <i>that</i> easy to run into but if your compiler complains that a variable is a function, then you know you've 
found it.</p>
<p>Just to add to the fun, you can't even <a href="Initialization.html">omit the parens for some types.</a></p>
