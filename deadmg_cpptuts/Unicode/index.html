<p>Unicode is about representing international text. Conceptually, text is a simple thing, but the unfortunate reality is that representing text from any language and dealing with them all is really, really, not. In 
addition, C++ has notably terrible support for this. I'm only going to go over the basics because describing the implementation of a Unicode string class would be far out of the scope of these tutorials. But here lies a 
brief overview of what Unicode is, why it's so annoying and why you can't do without it.</p>
