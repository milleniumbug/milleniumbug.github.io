<p>These topics cover important points that you must know in order to continue. There's quite a bit here, so take your time.</p>

<p>In the first section, you will learn about the basic functionality of the language- how to structure simple functions which can perform simple actions.</p>
<p>In the next section, you will learn about multiple functions and how they can make your life easier. You will also learn some of the necessary language features for avoiding repetitive work, and the basics of classes.</p>
<p>Next, you will cover everything you need to know to deal with multiple source files, apart from pain.</p>
<p>Finally, if you wish to move past the beginner section, you will have to master pointers and recursion- a nasty pair of concepts which many people never get past.</p>
